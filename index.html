        <h1> HOBBY </h1>
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p>My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
            started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
            kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy
            when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.
            I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my
            favourite author, Enid Blyton who writes “FAMOUS FIVE AND THE RIDDLE SERIES” . there are lot of books in the world , but my favourite one is the "Riddle Series". There are a lot of
            advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
            vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me
            an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different
            cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.
            I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it
            at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very
            challenging.

        <h1> MY INSPIRATION </h1>
        <p> The component company Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm had its roots in the aircraft maker Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) founded in 1926 and a company started by the German aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt in 1923. The two manufacturers merged in 1927 under the BFW name, which became Messerschmitt AG in 1938. </p>
